# GoShell

GoShell is a lightweight, cross-platform shell built using Go. It allows you to execute basic commands, navigate directories, and interact with your system in a terminal-like environment. With support for both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), GoShell provides an easy-to-use interface for basic shell operations.

## Features
