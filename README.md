# GoShell

GoShell is a lightweight, cross-platform shell built using Go. It allows you to execute basic commands, navigate directories, and interact with your system in a terminal-like environment. With support for both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), GoShell provides an easy-to-use interface for basic shell operations.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS).
- **Basic Shell Commands**:
  - `cd [path]` - Change the current directory.
  - `ls [path]` / `dir [path]` - List files in a directory (aliases `ls` to `dir` on Windows).
  - `exit` - Exit the shell.
  - `help` - Display the help message.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to add more built-in commands in the future.
